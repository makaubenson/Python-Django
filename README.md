# Python-Django
A python-django project where I implemented django authentication and password reset
The frontend of this website has been done using HTML/CSS, Bootstrap 4 and Javascript.
The backend has been achieved using python-django.

The project was meant to achieve authentification as well as password reset options using django framework for python. 
I hosted the project on heroku since it offers a free tier.
